        "DICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. It is a standard format used for storing and transmitting medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. DICOM files contain both image data and metadata, which includes information about the patient, the imaging equipment used, and the imaging procedure itself.\n",
        "DICOM images are used in medical image processing tasks such as segmentation, registration, and classification. Segmentation is the process of separating an image into multiple regions or objects. Registration is the process of aligning two or more images of the same subject taken at different times or with different imaging modalities. Classification is the process of assigning a label to an image based on its content.\n",
        "Pydicom is a Python library that provides an easy-to-use interface for working with DICOM files. It allows you to read, modify, and write DICOM files using Python code. Pydicom provides access to important information elements such as patient name, patient ID, study date, study time, modality, and more. Here’s an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use pydicom to access these information elements:\n"

        "The slice thickness makes sense, and is always in millimeters, and is the distance from the ‘top’ of the slice to the ‘bottom’. Note this is **not** always the same as the slice spacing! Because DICOM is usually a one-slice at a time data object, one must do much more work to figure out slice spacing since it is the distance between two slices. While it is common for all the slices in a series to have (*nearly*) the same spacing, that is not required, and was not as common in the early days of CT imaging.\n",
        "\n",
        "And since DICOM file names do not necessarily correlate with their position, you must go through each file and sort them into slice position order and then figure out the spacing. That sounds simple, but again is not quite so easy since the slice position is (usually) a string with a letter indicating ‘L’, ‘R’,  ‘A’, ’P’, ’S’, or ‘I’, and then a number indicating how (in millimeters) far left or right or anterior, etc., it is from isocenter.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "While slice thickness refers to the edges of the voxel, the pixel dimensions refer to the spacing between pixels in the X and Y dimensions, and DICOM does expect the spacing to be constant for this image. (There are exceptions for modalities like ultrasound where there can be an 'inset' image with a different magnification).\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we know about the size of the pixels, what about the orientation? Many imaging devices can acquire an image in almost any plane, but CT scanners nearly always (now) acquire axial images, and other planes are reconstructed from that. MRI is more variable, and for many organs, the images are acquired in an oblique orientation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Briefly about orientation names: ‘axial’ (also called ‘transverse’ or ‘transaxial’) means an image that is perpendicular to the long axis of the body. Furthermore, its left and right (‘X’) axis is also the left and right axis of the object being imaged, and the ‘Y’ axis of the image is considered to be in the anterior-posterior direction. A ‘Coronal’ image gets its name from the coronal suture of the skull, which is at the top of the head and is a plane that is like facing the patient: the ‘X’ axis of the image is also the ‘X’ axis of the patient, but the ‘Y’ axis of the image is the ‘Z’ axis (inferior-superior) of the patient. Sagittal gets its name from the sagittal suture, which is the connection between the left and right halves of the skull. Therefore, its ‘X’ axis is the anterior-posterior line of the patient, and its ‘Y’ axis is the  ‘Z’ axis of the patient.\n",

        "\n",
        "The relationship between moving 1 pixel along the ‘X’ axis of the image is thus represented as 3 floating point values: the change in ‘X’ of the <u>patient</u>, the change in ‘Y’ of the <u>patient</u>, and the change in ‘Z’ of the <u>patient</u>. Similarly, there is another set of 3 values for showing the change as one moves along the ‘Y’ axis of the image, again representing the ‘X’, ‘Y’, and ‘Z’ change in the patient. This set of 6 values completely defines the orientation of the image, and they are known as directional cosines. In this case, the (1.0,0.0,0.0) means that the X-direction of the image moves 1.0 along the X-axis of the patient and 0 in the Y and Z axes. The second set of 3 numbers (0.0, 0.996, -0.078) means it moves 0 along the patient X axis, almost 1 (0.996) along the Y-axis, and just a little bit negative along the patient Z axis as we move along Y in the image (-0.078). From these, one can compute the orientation of the slice:\n"

Tags include information such as demographic details about the patient, imaging study’s acquisition parameters, image dimensions, matrix size, color space, and more. This makes it easier to manage and exchange medical images between different devices from multiple manufacturers.\n",

The DICOM standard group numbers (the first number of the pair) are even numbers. One can have (non-standard) tags in a DICOM file that have odd numbers. These are called 'Private Tags' and their content and meaning are defined by the creator. This allows vendors to store information relevant to an image in cases where the DICOM Committee has not defined a tag.\n",

Vendors (and researchers) created diffusion-weighted images and the information (like B-value) was usually stored in private tags, but each vendor stored this informatoin in the private tag they defined (and this sometimes changed with different software versions). Once the community is using an image type enough, the DICOM Committee will create a working group that will define what the tags should be and they then become a part of the standard tag set. Then the vendors must update their scanner software to reflect this.\n",

        "HL7 defines several types of messages for exchanging healthcare information. These messages serve different purposes and are used in various healthcare scenarios. Some of the most common types of HL7 messages include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer) Messages (HL7 v2.3 and later):** These messages are used for patient demographic and visit information, including admissions, discharges, and transfers. They provide details about a patient's admission to or discharge from a healthcare facility and any changes in their demographic information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ORM (Order Message) and ORU (Observation Result Message) Messages (HL7 v2.3 and later):** ORM messages are used to transmit orders for laboratory tests, procedures, or medications. ORU messages, on the other hand, convey the results of these orders, such as lab results, diagnostic reports, or imaging studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **SIU (Scheduling Information Unsolicited) Messages (HL7 v2.3 and later):** These messages contain unsolicited scheduling information, such as appointment notifications, cancellations, and rescheduling updates.\n",

        "FHIR is a modern healthcare interoperability standard developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7) starting in 2016, due to challenges around HL7, particuarly querying information, but also the desire to have a protocol using modern IT technologies. FHIR is designed to address the challenges of exchanging healthcare data in a more efficient, flexible, and standardized manner. It has gained significant attention and adoption within the healthcare informatics field due to its innovative approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "FHIR is based on modern web standards like RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) and uses widely adopted data formats like JSON and XML for data exchange. This approach makes it developer-friendly and accessible for software applications and web services. It follows the \"resource\" model, where healthcare data is represented as resources with standardized data elements and relationships. Resources can represent various healthcare entities, such as patients, providers, medications, and observations.\n",
        "FHIR emphasizes granular data exchange. Instead of sending large, complex documents, it allows the exchange of individual data elements or resources. This granularity enables precise data retrieval and efficient updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "FHIR defines a set of standardized resources, each representing a specific aspect of healthcare data. For example, the \"Patient\" resource contains demographic information, while the \"Observation\" resource represents clinical observations like lab results or vital signs. Each resource has a well-defined structure with common data elements (attributes) and relationships to other resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "FHIR allows for extensibility by enabling the addition of custom data elements or extensions to existing resources. This flexibility accommodates local or specialized data requirements. This can lead to challenges if you don't know the definitions of these added messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, for the previous HL7 message, the OBR segment can be reorderd as the following FHIR message:\n",

        "In summary, FHIR is a groundbreaking standard in healthcare informatics that addresses the need for flexible, efficient, and standardized data exchange in the digital healthcare landscape. Its adoption continues to grow, and it plays a crucial role in achieving healthcare interoperability, supporting innovation in healthcare applications, and improving patient care."

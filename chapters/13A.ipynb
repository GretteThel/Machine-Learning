        "####Deep neural networks have shown great promise in various domains, including images, audio, and text. Several commonly used methods encode raw data into meaningful representations in these domains [1, 2, 3].In most real-world applications, such canonical architectures perform well. However, deep learning approaches have lagged behind traditional methods when applied to tabular data. Tabular data consists of samples (rows) with a consistent set of features (columns) and is the most common data type in real-world applications [1,2]. Tabular data is routinely used in many fields, such as medicine, finance, manufacturing, and climate science. This section discusses state-of-the-art traditional machine learning approaches and recent advances in deep neural models applied to tabular data. Traditional machine learning methods, such as gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) [4], dominated tabular data modeling and outperformed deep learning during the previous decade. Despite their theoretical advantages [5, 6, 7], deep neural networks face several challenges when applied to tabular data such as lack of locality, difficulty handling data sparsity (missing values), or mixed feature types (numerical, ordinal, and categorical), and a lack of prior knowledge about the dataset structure (unlike with text or images).Furthermore, deep neural networks are regarded as a \"black box\" approach, in which the way input data is transformed into model outputs is opaque or difficult to understand [5, 7]. Despite the \"no free lunch\" principle [8], tree-ensemble algorithms, such as XGBoost, remain recommended for real-world tabular data problems [1].Several recent studies have applied deep learning to the tabular data domain, introducing new neural architectures to improve tabular data performance, briefly discussed below [10, 9, 13]. Some claim to outperform traditional standard approaches like GBDT. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a standard benchmark (such as ImageNet [10] and GLUE [11]), publications in this field tend to use different datasets, making apples-to-apples comparisons difficult.\n"

Differentiability is a key mathematical property that makes it possible to predict the best direction to change parameters during the process of training a model; this is known as gradient descent optimization and is the primary method for training deep neural networks. Differentiable tree methods seek ways to make decision trees differentiable, because of their excellent performance on tabular data.  These methods generally do this by smoothing the decision functions in the internal tree nodes to make the tree function and tree routing differentiable [14], allowing the advantages of decision trees to be incorporated into deep neural networks.\n",

The encoder uses sparsemax (a new activation function similar to the traditional softmax) layers to choose a small number of features. Learning masks have the advantage that feature selection does not have to be all-or-nothing. A learnable mask can make a soft decision instead of a hard threshold on a feature, which relaxes traditional (non-differentiable) feature selection methods [9].\n"
